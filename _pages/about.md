Hello! I am Zihan Hao (郝梓涵), a senior-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), a pilot class led by Prof. [Andrew Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/) at [Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/).

My research interests lie broadly in **Quantum Computation**, **Quantum Information**, and **Theoretical Computer Science**. I delve deeper into the disciplinary of Quantum Computation and Cryptography. I have worked on both Quantum and Cryptography, with topics centered around Quantum Randomized Measurements and Laconic Function Evaluation(LFE) respectively.

Here are my [CV](../assets/CV_ZihanHao.pdf).
