<!-- My research interests lie broadly in **Quantum Computation**, **Quantum Information**, and **Cryptography**. I delve deeper into understanding the power of quantum computers with perspectives like cryptography. I have worked on both Quantum and Cryptography, with topics centered around quantum state learning with randomized measurements and laconic function evaluation(LFE), respectively. -->
